Rearrange Digits:

A reverse merge sort was implemented. 
The descending ordered list. Rearrangement has been implemented to arrange all even indexed digits and odd indexed digits into separate numbers

Time Complexity:
Merge Sort has been used - O(n log n)

Space Complexity:
Space complexity of Merge Sort is O(n)
Auxillary space to consider:
List to store the descending ordered list - again O(n)
Overall Space complexity is O(n)
