AutoComplete Trie:

Implemented a Trie where TrieNode stores each part of the word
used recursive search to check for condition is_word == True

Time Complexity:
O(n), where n is the number of nodes of longest word or length of longest word

Space Complexity:
O(n), where n is the number of TrieNode used to store the longest word
Auxillary space to consider:
suffix_collection for storing the suffixes
