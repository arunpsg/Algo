**Unsorted Array:**

Assigned the max and min as the first list element, and then iterate over each list element to see if a larger or smaller element appears during traversal.
 
Time complexity: O(n)
An array traversal of length n is required and thus O(n)

Space Complexity: 
O(n), where n is the length of the array to store the input
