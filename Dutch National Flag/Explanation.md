Dutch National Flag:

Grouped zeros, ones, twos and created a sorted list by appending all the three

Time Complexity:
O(n): where n is the length of input items
As input list is traversed to group the zeros, ones and twos

Space Complexity:
O(n): where n is the length of input items
An array is required to store the entire input list and traversed
Auxiliary space to consider: Storing Zeros, Ones and twos
