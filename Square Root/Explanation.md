**Square Root:**

Sort of Binary Search is used to calculate Square Root.
The list of numbers between 0 and the input number is taken in a natural sorted array, which is suitable to use Binary Search 

Time Complexity:
Binary search time complexity is O(log n), where n is length of the input
Time will increase logarithmically as the list to be search will be halved each time

Space Complexity:
Space complexity of Binary Search is O(log n)
Space used to store the array also increases logarithmically as the list to store the data will be halved each time
