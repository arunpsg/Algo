**Rotated Array Search:**

Used Binary Search to search for the pivot and compared with the target.
Again used Binary search to find if the target it present in the list

Time Complexity:
Binary search has O(logn), We used Binary search twice in worst case
Still O(logn)

Space Complexity:
Binary Search has Space complexity of O(logn). 
Auzillary space to consider:
Array used to store the input O(n)
Overall Space complexity: O(n + logn)
